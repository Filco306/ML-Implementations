# ML-Implementations
Side project worked on when there is time. Intention is to implement algorithms from scratch and visualize, preferrably with 2D-data. 

Still not commented sufficiently. Will be done when time is sufficient. 

Implemented so far: 
- K-means
  - K-means online
  - Lloyd's algorithm
  - Summarizing data into coresets TBD
- K-nearest neighbours
  - Binary classification 
  K-nearest density estimation
- SVM
  - Stochastic gradient descent
  - Dual function (very slow, needs improvements) but possible to use with kernels
  - ADAM
- Regression
  - Closed form solution
  - Polynomial Regression
- Some different Kernels 
- Perception
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Useful functions, such as:
  - Generating cluster data
  - Generating polynomial data
  - Euclidian distance for two matrices
  - Partition and use data k-foldly for cross-validation
  - Standardize data frames and matrices.
