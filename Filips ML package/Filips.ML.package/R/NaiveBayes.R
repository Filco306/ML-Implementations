#' Naive Bayes non-parametric
#'
#' This function is a very simple implementation of stochastic gradient descent.
#' Step size is set to 1/sqrt(t), which is a common stepsize, but one should be able to alter it.
#' @param train is the training data to perform the density estimation on
#' @param trainLabels are the labels for the training
#' @param trainLabels is the y vector
